          i.fas.fa-database
          | 1. Information We Collect
        p To provide the Eporia service, we collect specific types of information from you.
        
        h3 A. Information You Provide
        ul
          li <strong>Account Data:</strong> Your handle, email address, password (hashed), and profile image.
          li <strong>Profile Data:</strong> Your bio, location (City/State), and "Anthem" song selection.
          li <strong>Payment Data:</strong> We do not store full credit card numbers. All payment processing is handled securely by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We only retain transaction receipts and your Stripe Customer ID.

        h3 B. Information We Collect Automatically
        ul
          li <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Songs you play, skip, like, or add to crates. This is critical for our "Fair Trade" allocation model.
          li <strong>Device Data:</strong> IP address, device type, and browser version for security and debugging.
          li <strong>Location Data:</strong> We derive your general location (City/State) from your IP address or user settings to power the "Local Scene" discovery features.

      //- 2. HOW WE USE DATA

        h2 
          i.fas.fa-tasks
          | 2. How We Use Your Data
        p We use your information to operate, maintain, and improve the Eporia platform.
        
        h3 A. Fair Trade Allocations
        p Eporia is unique because your subscription fee goes to the artists you actually support.
        .highlight-box
          strong The Calculation:
          | We use your listening history, "Likes," and "Follows" to calculate the "Proof of Fandom" score. This score determines how your monthly subscription credits are distributed to artists.

        h3 B. Local Discovery
        p We use your location data to show you "Fresh Drops" and "Community Crates" from artists in your city.
        
        h3 C. Platform Security
        p We use device fingerprinting and usage patterns to detect and prevent "stream farming," bot activity, and account sharing.

      //- 3. DATA SHARING
      .legal-section
        h2 
          i.fas.fa-share-alt
          | 3. How We Share Information
        p We do not sell your personal data to advertisers. We share data only in the following ways:
        
        ul
          li <strong>With Artists:</strong> Artists receive aggregated data about their performance (e.g., "100 plays from San Diego"). We do not share your email or private contact info with artists unless you explicitly opt-in.
          li <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use trusted third parties to help us operate:
            ul
              li <strong>Google Cloud / Firebase:</strong> For secure data hosting and authentication.
              li <strong>Stripe:</strong> For payment processing and artist payouts.
              li <strong>Cloudflare R2:</strong> For media storage and delivery.

          li <strong>Download Data:</strong> You may request a copy of your listening history and transaction logs by contacting support.
          li <strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account at any time via the Settings page. 
        .highlight-box
          strong Note on Deletion:
