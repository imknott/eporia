        | 1. Appointment of Eporia as Authorized Agent
      p By using Eporia, you hereby appoint Eporia as your <strong>limited payment collection agent</strong>. You agree that:
      ul
        li Eporia is authorized to process and receive payments from fans on your behalf.
        li The fan's obligation to pay you is satisfied upon Eporia's receipt of the subscription funds.
        li Eporia is responsible for remitting these funds to you, minus the agreed platform fee (10-30%) and any applicable processing costs.

        p(style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0")
          | You will receive a percentage of the net revenue generated by subscribers who allocate their membership credits to your profile. 
          | <strong>Payouts are triggered automatically via Stripe Connect once your balance meets the $50 USD threshold.</strong>

          i.fas.fa-seedling
          | 2. The Community Dividend
        p Eporia retains a standard platform fee (10%) to cover operational costs. To foster a healthy ecosystem, we redistribute a portion of this fee as a "Community Dividend" to support committed creators.
        
        p To prevent abuse (e.g., "stream farming" via bot accounts) and reward genuine effort, the Dividend is reserved for <strong>Qualified Creators</strong> only.
        
        .criteria-box
          .criteria-title Eligibility Requirements
          ul
            li <strong>Tenure:</strong> You must have maintained an active artist profile for at least <strong>3 months (90 days)</strong>.
            li <strong>Catalog Depth:</strong> You must have released at least one (1) <strong>Full Album</strong> (defined as a collection of 7+ tracks or 20+ minutes of audio). Single-song accounts do not qualify.
            li <strong>Originality:</strong> Your qualifying album must consist of 100% original compositions. Remixes, covers, and DJ sets do not count toward this requirement.
            li <strong>Active Status:</strong> You must log in to the Studio Dashboard at least once per month to demonstrate active management.
            
        p <em>Note: Popularity is NOT a requirement. We reward the act of creation, not just the result of fame.</em>

      //- 3. ANTI-FRAUD
      .legal-section
        h2 
          i.fas.fa-shield-alt
          | 3. Anti-Fraud & Manipulation
        p Because Eporia is User-Centric, stream farming is financially ineffective. A bot account can only payout the specific subscription fee it paid in.
        p <strong>Prohibited conduct includes:</strong>
        ul
          li Creating fake accounts to manipulate the "Community Dividend."
          li Impersonating other artists to hijack "Auto-Allocation."
          li Coercing users to allocate funds against their will.
        p Any attempt to manipulate these systems results in immediate account termination and forfeiture of all earnings.

          | 4. Code of Conduct
        p Eporia is a destination for professional-grade audio. By joining, you agree to:
        ul
          li <strong>Quality First:</strong> Upload only your best, finished material.
          li <strong>Respect the Listener:</strong> Do not upload misleading content or "clickbait" audio (e.g., white noise).
          li <strong>Do No Harm:</strong> Do not use the platform to harass, bully, or incite violence.

      //- 5. TERMINATION

          | 5. Freedom to Leave
        p This agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party.
        p You may remove your content at any time. Upon removal, any outstanding wallet balance will be paid out in the next cycle (Net-30), and your content will be removed from streaming servers within 24 hours.

      //- 6. TAXES & INDEPENDENT STATUS

          | 6. Tax Responsibility & 1099 Reporting
        p You are an independent contractor and not an employee of Eporia (pursuant to California AB 2257). 
        p <strong>Tax Reporting:</strong> You are solely responsible for all taxes on your earnings. Eporia (via Stripe) will issue a <strong>Form 1099-NEC</strong> if your annual earnings exceed the IRS reporting threshold (currently $2,000 for the 2026 tax year).
